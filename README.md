# A90
funny doors reference except its REAL

a90 is from roblox rooms i think and then roblox doors took that and put it in their game

# WHAT IS THIS
its a program for WINDOWS HAHA
(i hate linux and mac os)

basically if you know A-90 he shows up randomly and attacks you if you move your mouse so i made a program that does that on your computer

# EPIC WARNINGS
he CAN close all your current windows
(im not responsible for any data loss caused by this, you have the option to turn it off if you have important things opened)

to stop A-90 you can click on his window on the taskbar and press Alt + F4

I tried to make him avoid certain programs but he can and likely will close programs that end up bypassing my checks either purposely or accidentally. If you are really worried, use a VM or something idk

BE CAREFUL WITH RUNNING HIM ON HIGH SPEEDS IF YOU HAVE CLOSE WINDOWS ENABLED. He can and will start bugging out your computer.
