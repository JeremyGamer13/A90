# A90
funny doors reference except its REAL

a90 is from roblox rooms i think and then roblox doors took that and put it in their game

# WHAT IS THIS
its a program for WINDOWS!!!!!!!!
(i will not make this work with linux and mac os myself)

basically if you know A-90 he shows up randomly and attacks you if you move your mouse so i made a program that does that on your computer

# WARNINGS
he CAN close all your current windows
(im not responsible for any data loss caused by this, you have the option to turn it off if you have important things opened)

to stop A-90 you can click on his window on the taskbar and close it, click on the window and press Alt + F4, or close A90 or Electron in Task Manager

I tried to make him avoid certain programs but he can and likely will close programs that end up bypassing my checks either purposely or accidentally. If you are really worried, use a VM or something idk
